# Development Environment

## Ways to Develop a Mobile App Using React Native

### 1. React Native Framework

- Develop a mobile app using the core React Native framework, which provides the foundational tools for building cross-platform native mobile applications.
- Requires configuration of development environments, and access to native development tools.

### 2. Expo

- Develop a mobile app using Expo, a set of tools and services built on top of React Native.
- Streamlines the development process, eliminating the need for complex native development configurations.
- Ideal for quickly building and testing mobile apps, especially during prototyping and development sprints.

## Expo Tools

|Tool|Description|
|---|---|
|Expo CLI command-line|The `expo` CLI is a command-line tool used to manage, and develop Expo projects. It provides commands for project building, testing, and publishing apps.|
|create-expo-app|The `create-expo-app` is a command-line tool used to create Expo projects. It provides commands for project initialization, packages installations, and templates.|
|expo-doctor| Diagnose issues with the project|
|Expo Go|Expo Go is a mobile app available on both iOS and Android that allows developers to preview and test their Expo projects on real devices without the need for emulator setups|
|Expo Snack|Online emulator to develop your React Native app online in the Expo environment|

## Requirements

To develop mobile app using expo, you need to have the following:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) **Node.js LTS releases (even-numbered) are recommended**
- [Microsoft Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) Source Control

## Javascript Language

**JavaScript** is a high-level, versatile, and widely used programming language. It is primarily known for its role in web development but can be applied in various contexts.

JavaScript works in both browser and Node.js environments, and it operates in two primary modes:

- **Web Browsers**: JavaScript is predominantly used in web browsers to add interactivity and dynamic behavior to websites. It interacts with the Document Object Model (DOM), responds to user events, and communicates with web servers to create web applications.
- **Node.js**: Node.js is a server-side runtime environment that enables the execution of JavaScript outside of web browsers. It is commonly used for building server-side applications, web servers, APIs, and command-line tools. Node.js extends JavaScript's capabilities with built-in modules for I/O operations, networking, and more.

**NPM (Node Package Manager)** is a package manager for JavaScript and Node.js. It is the default package manager for Node.js, and it is one of the largest software registries in the world. NPM is used for installing, managing, and sharing packages (libraries, modules, and dependencies)

**NPX (Package Runner)** npx is a package runner tool that comes with npm (Node Package Manager) and is used to execute packages **from the npm registry**. It is particularly useful for running binaries from packages without having to install them globally or in your project.
